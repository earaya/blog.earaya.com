My name is Esteban Araya, and I am a computer enthusiast. I crave writing good software; conjuring up programs from a few lines of simple, clean code is extremely rewarding.

I started programming at an early age: I still remember when my parents brought our first [80286 computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) home (I must have been about 8 or so), and immediately taking a liking to it. I wrote as many [MS-BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC) games as my friends were willing to play, and I haven't stopped coding since.

I'm passionate about my craft. I constantly read [books](/recommended-books) on the subject and I'm constantly practicing and improving my skills. I honestly hope you find something of value from what I've learned in my years of tinkering with computers.

Thanks for stopping by. And happy hacking!

-Esteban
