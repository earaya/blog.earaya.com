My name is Esteban Araya, and I am computer enthusiast. I really enjoy writing good software; I find that few other activities are as rewarding as writing a few lines of simple, clean code.

I started programming at an early age: I still remember when my parents brought our first 80286 computer home (I must have been about 8 or so), and immediately taking a liking to it. I wrote as many MS-BASIC games as my friends were willing to play, and I haven't stopped coding since.

I'm passionate about my craft. I constantly read books on the subject and I'm constantly practicing and improving my skills.

You can also find me on Google+, StackOverflow, and GitHub.

Thanks for stopping by. And happy hacking!
