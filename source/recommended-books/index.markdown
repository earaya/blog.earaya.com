Here's a list of books I've read and would gladly recommend to anyone else. No particular order, no categories, just some great books.

**The Design of Every Day Things**

If your users don't immediately and intuitively know how to use your product, you've failed. It's not that your users are stupid, you just failed. Get over it, and make your design better.

**Peopleware**

Writing software is all about the people. Make sure you take good care of you programmers and enable them to succeed.

**Code Complete**

Honestly, by the time I read this book, I felt like I knew and did *most* of the stuff it recommends. However, it was good to get some validation, and know that good practices make a difference.

**Ender's Game**

I like most of Card's stuff, but Ender's Game is just a classic.

**Cien AÃ±os de Soledad (One Hundred Years of Solitude)**

This is the only book I can think of that I've read multiple times. It's just an unbelievable novel... I can't do it justice. Please go read it (in Spanish if you can).
